# Speechify-

Speechify is a TTS Chrome extension created by Rawad to assist language learners,
individuals with visual impairments like dyslexia, and those who prefer listening over reading.
Users can simply select any text on a webpage, right click, and choose "Speechify" to have it read aloud.
The extension also provides control over the reading experience, allowing users to pause, resume, or stop the speech at any time using the buttons in the extension.
Speechify aims to make web content more accessible and enjoyable for everyone.
